	<p2>I am a graduate student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University. Prior to entering the graduate program in Aarhus, I spent a year at the political science department at the University of California, San Diego. More recently I visited Stanford University.</p2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p2>My research focuses on how citizens make sense of relatively complex and abstract issues such as the state of the national economy. Inspired by work in social and political psychology, most of my work grapples with how and when citizens' prior commitments influence their thinking about national economic conditions. Some of my work also addresses whether citizens' inferences are guided by objective circumstances in their everyday lives.</p2>
