	<p2>I am a graduate student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University. I recently visisted Stanford University and prior to entering the graduate program in Aarhus I spent a year at the political science department at UCSD.</p2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p2>My research focuses on how citizens make sense of relatively complex and abstract issues such as the state of the national economy. Inspired by work in social and political psychology, most of my work grapples with how and when citizens' prior commitments influence their thinking about abstract issues.</p2>
